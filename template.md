# FCP -1: FreeBSD Community Proposal Template

This is a good place for an abstract. Abstracts are a brief summary of the
content of the proposal. For example this is a template and as such acts as
a guide, though not a strict one, as to how your FreeBSD Community Proposal
should be formatted.

## Problem Statement

A good way to start your FreeBSD Community Proposal is to describe in a
sufficient level of clarity the problem you're trying to solve. In this case
we lack a simple example for contributors to follow when writing their
proposals.

## Problem Discussion

This is where we can go into the problem in more detail. For instance in this
case we can talk about how the lack of an example FCP means that people may
not write up proposals as they don't know exactly how to structure the
document. The lack of an example could also lead to a bunch of issues that
would need to be brought up by people on the fcp-editors list. While the
fcp-editors list is a resource that should absolutely be used for advice and
discussion on your FCP before you put it up for discussion an example would
cover the most obvious issues and mean that the fcp-editors could focus on
other issues. Lastly having an example would just be nice.

## Proposed Solution

We will write an example FCP that provides a decent template for contributors
to follow. This example FCP will be provided as a template and will follow all
the basic formatting and structure conventions we want to see from an FCP.

## Solution Discussion

Clear-eyed people may notice that the structure of this example is different
from that of [FCP 0](./FCP-0000.md). This is not a bug. In most cases
this structure will work but if it doesn't allow you to properly express and
discuss your proposal you should feel free to change that.

Formatting is a different matter. This example is in
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax), has
hard line breaks at 80 columns and has a metadata block at the top that
lists all the authors of this proposal and its current state. You should
always do these things in your proposal.

Once you've finished writing your proposal you should follow the instructions
in [FCP 0](./FCP-0000.md) to move forward.

Good luck!

## Final Disposition

This section is for detailing the reasoning behind the final status of the FCP.
If you withdraw your FCP you can outline your reasons here. If core accepts
or rejects the FCP they can add their reasoning here. It should not be present
in FCPs prior to the `accepted`, `rejected` or `withdrawn` states.
