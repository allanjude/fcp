# FCP 0: FreeBSD Community Proposal Process and Authoring Guide

Requests for Discussion are an idea originally promulgated by Joyent
and based on the work with Requests for Comments, originating with the
IETF.  The FreeBSD project has adopted a similar model of discussion and
collaboration to facilitate major changes to the code or community of the
project.

Unlike RFCs from the IETF, our FCPs are maintained in
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax)
format which provides more formal formatting structure and is also a format
that is broadly used in the open source community.

If you are unfamiliar with the IETF's Request for Comments (RFC) system please
read [RFC 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3).

FCPs also use the IETF interpretations of the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" as defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The rest of this FCP documents when, why and how to write an FCP.

## When should I write an FCP?

The purpose of the FCP process is to document the design decisions behind
proposed changes and to gather feedback from the many different types of users
that make up the FreeBSD Community, to better understand how each change will
impact those users.

An FCP MUST be written when:
* Any change that lacks consensus or is contended.
* Creating, changing or removing a feature that is likely to cause user
  confusion, i.e. a violatin of the Principle of Least Astonishment or POLA.
* Breaking changes to the behaviour of existing commands or libraries.
* Substantive change to the behaviour or function of the ports or packaging
  system.
* Major changes to how people interact with the FreeBSD Community.
* A change that is proposed or committed which results in significant
  objections should use the FCP process to come to a resolution.

Every FCP MUST have a title that is a simple synopsis of the document. Titles
are not fixed; FCPs are numbered to allow the title to change. An FCP MUST
have the following attributes:

* **Title**: This is a simple synopsis of the document. Note, the title is not
  fixed. It may change as the FCP evolves.
* **Number**: This allows easy reference to the FCP and should be allocated as
  described below.
* **Metadata**: This tracks the author(s) and state of the FCP.

An FCP SHOULD address the following questions:

##### What is the problem you're trying to solve?

The classic question for anyone who wants to change or enhance an existing
system.  The problem you're trying to solve is the goal you wish to achieve,
whether it's a new feature, a change to an existing one, or the removal of an
ambiguity in how the system works.

##### How will users interact with these new or changed features?

You MUST consider all users of the system, and not just a specific
itch that you wish to scratch.  How will this change affect users?
How will it affect existing scripts or other integrations with the system?
How will it impact programs that link against libraries in the base system.
You MUST also consider how these changes might affect those who have
built products on top of FreeBSD.

##### List the public private interfaces that are changing.

If a public interface, such as a command line program or its
arguments, a library, or a syscall, is to be changed then list it here along
with a brief, 1 or 2 line, description of the intended change.

Changes to private interfaces, those consumed by other internal parts
of FreeBSD MUST also be listed with a similarly brief description of
the intended change.

##### What is the upgrade impact?

What are the implications to current users of FreeBSD if they upgrade
their systems to a newer version that includes this change? Can the change be
merged to the stable branch? Any such changes MUST be added to the UPDATING
file in the main FreeBSD repository.

##### What is the security impact?

What (untrusted) user input (including both data and code) will be made visible
to the system as part of the change?  Which components will interact with that
input?  How will that input be validated and managed securely?  What new or
changed privileges will your feature require?  How can the new code be
sandboxed?  How might an attacker use the proposed facilities to escalate their
privileges?

## Mechanics of an FCP

To create a new FCP, an author MUST take the following steps.

### Create and check out a fork of the FCP repository

The author MUST fork the [FCP repository](https://github.com/freebsd/fcp). Once
this is done this they should make a local copy:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/freebsd/fcp.git
```

### Create an FCP document with a new number

FCPs are numbered starting at 100. The first 100 FCPs, including this one, are
reserved for documenting the processes of the FreeBSD Project. When an FCP is
started, the next currently unallocated number MUST be used. For example if the
next FCP would be number 314 then the file name fcp-0314.md would be used. Note
that while leading zeroes are used in the file name they are not needed when
referring to the FCP in discussion.

It is advisable to use a branch to add your FCP for easier handling of pull
requests.

```
$ cd fcp
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b my-new-fcp
$ cp template.md fcp-0314.md
$ git add fcp-0314.md
$ git commit
$ git push -u origin my-new-fcp
```

### Write the FCP

FCPs MUST have a default text width of 80 characters. Any other materials
related to an FCP SHOULD be named fcp-XXXX-file-name.type such as
fcp-0314-example-code.c.

#### FCP Metadata

Every FCP document starts with a brief amount of metadata in the
[python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata)
metadata format which looks like this:

```
---
authors: Committer Name <committer@freebsd.org>,
    Collaborator Name <collaborator@example>
state: draft
---
```

Only the `authors`, and the `state` are tracked.  There MAY be any number of
`authors`, they MUST be listed with their name and e-mail address for proper
attribution.

### Submitting the FCP

Once the FCP has been written and is ready for further dissemination you should
make sure that all your changes are committed and pushed to your local fork:

```
$ git add fcp-0314.md
$ git commit
$ git push
```

Then you should open a pull request against the
[FCP repository](https://github.com/freebsd/fcp). You should paste the title
of your FCP in as the title of the pull request. If a numbering conflict
arises you should update the number of your FCP both in the document and in
the filename:

```
$ git mv fcp-0314.md fcp-0315.md
$ git commit
$ git push
```

### Start the discussion

Once your pull request has been accepted you should send an e-mail to
fcp@freebsd.org announcing the FCP.

The subject of the message MUST be the FCP number and synopsis. For example, if
your FCP number 314 with the title Addition of new mbuf subroutines, then the
subject would be `FCP 314: FreeBSD Change Request Process and Authoring Guide`.

Make sure to include a link to the FCP in the body of the email.

### Finishing up

When discussion has wrapped up and the relevant feedback has been incorporated,
then you change the state of the document to `vote` state, and send a
notification to core@freebsd.org. Core will then hold a vote. The core
secretary will announce the decision,  and the FCP document will be moved out
of the `drafts` directory.

### Changes after publishing

FCPs may need to be revised after they have been moved into the `accepted`
state.  If the changes are minor then you SHOULD update the FCP but if they the
changes are major you SHOULD withdraw the current FCP and start a new one.

## FCP States

An FCP can be in one of the following states:

1. draft
1. feedback
1. vote
1. accepted
1. rejected
1. withdrawn

As noted above an FCP is first created in the `draft` state. Before publicizing
the FCP to the mailing lists, author(s) are encouraged to contact
fcp-editors@freebsd.org for editorial review. Once the draft is ready, it moves
to the `feedback` state, and is published to the fcp@freebsd.org mailing list,
and CCd to the appropriate technical lists.

The `feedback` state is where all discussion of the FCP takes place.
Developers and users will provide feedback on the design of the proposed
feature, and its impact on their use of FreeBSD. Many FCPs will eventually have
code attached to them, for both review and testing.

When the discussion of a change has come to a suitable and acceptable close it
SHOULD be updated to the `vote` state.

At this time the FreeBSD Core Team will vote on the subject of the FCP. The
result of vote moves the FCP into the `accepted` or `rejected` state.

Just because something is in the `accepted` state does not mean that it cannot
be updated and corrected. See the "Touching up" section for more information.

At any time the author(s) may decide to withdraw an FCP. If an FCP is not
viable or if an FCP must be ignored, it can be moved into the `withdrawn`
state.
